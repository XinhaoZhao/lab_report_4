1. The sequence I came up with:  
:%s/start/base/g (16 presses)

2. For the first one, it took me about 3 minutes to finish the task. For the second one, it took me 5 minutes. For the second strategy, my vim  
freezes for some reason and I had to restart the whole process.

3. I would choose the first strategy. Because for the first one, I get to finish the main task on my terminal and then scp it  
to the server, whereas for the other one I had to run everything on the server. 

4. For this project, since I am more comfortable with vscode than with vim, I feel this is a big factor that I prefer the first strategy   
over the second one.
